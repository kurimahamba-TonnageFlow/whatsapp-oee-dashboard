# ==========================================================
# TONNAGEFLOW PULSE
# Main HTTP API (HMI + WhatsApp)
# ==========================================================
#
# This is the process to run with uvicorn. It:
#   - Adds the versioned Production Run API (src/runs_api.py)
#   - Restricts CORS to the exact Pulse HMI origin (no wildcard)
#   - Mounts the existing, unmodified WhatsApp webhook app at "/" so
#     every route in src/whatsapp_webhook.py keeps working exactly as
#     it does today, including for its own existing test suite, which
#     imports that app directly and never touches this module.
#
# src/main.py (the CLI engine) is never imported here.
