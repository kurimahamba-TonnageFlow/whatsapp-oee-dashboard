# test/demo data (see tests/test_phase1_mvp_system.py and friends)
# never appears in dashboard results without deleting anything.
#
# All filter values are bound as parameters (%(name)s) - never string-
# interpolated into SQL. _TEST_DATA_EXCLUSION_SQL itself is a fixed
# literal maintained by this codebase, not user input.
#
# Schema gaps affecting these queries (see docs/dashboard_integration.md):
#   - hourly_updates has no timestamp column, so per-hour ordering uses
#     submission sequence (row id), not wall-clock time.
#   - engineering_updates has no timestamp column either; date filters
#     for it are approximated via its parent downtime_events.opened_at.
#   - There is no fault/downtime-type taxonomy beyond free text, so
#     "Machine Setup" vs "Machine Repair" cannot be computed here.

    Order is deliberately the reverse of close_engineering_fault(): the
    guarded UPDATE runs FIRST here. Its WHERE clause requires the fault
    to still be Ongoing, its engineering_status to still be 'Ongoing',
    engineer to be this exact authenticated engineer, and accepted_at to
    be non-NULL (i.e. genuinely accepted, not merely assigned) - the

    / close_engineering_fault(): the database's own row lock during the
    UPDATE is what makes concurrent requests (a second handover, a
    close, another accept racing this one) safe, not application-level
    locking.

    If the UPDATE matches zero rows, this function returns None
    immediately, WITHOUT ever attempting the history INSERT - there is
    nothing to roll back because nothing has been written yet. Only
    once the UPDATE succeeds does the handover-note INSERT run, on the

    caught here and the transaction is explicitly rolled back (undoing
    the UPDATE too) before the exception is re-raised - so no code path
    can ever commit the fault's release without its history record, or
    vice versa: both statements land together, or neither does.

    engineering_status literals here ('Not Started' for the released
    fault, 'Ongoing' for the history row) are deliberately NOT

# Requires migrations/0003_pulse_phase1_foundation.sql. Every write
# below runs in ONE transaction:
#   1. it first claims the client's Idempotency-Key (hmi_idempotency_keys),
#      so a double tap or a retry after a timeout replays the original
#      response instead of writing twice;
#   2. it locks the production_runs row (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE) before
#      reading anything it depends on, so concurrent writes on the same
#      run are serialised;
#   3. it stores the response it is about to return in the same
#      transaction before COMMIT.
# All manufacturing arithmetic is delegated to src/pulse_calculations.py
# (Decimal); this module only reads and writes rows.
